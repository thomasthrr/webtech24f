	<h1>Objective of my website:</h1>
    <p>My website will be a nightlife events marketplace where event goers can browse
        and find events they love. Fans can filter by location, date and price to find
        recommended searches quickly. By clicking on the event cover the fan will be able 
        to view the event page and discover who's performing, at what time it's happening etc.
    </p>
    <h1>My target audience:</h1>
    <p>I am looking for event goers of ages 21 - 35 who typically go to nightclubs during the weekend
        and enjoy going out to listen to good music. These people typically hang out in groups and 
        one person can influence many. We will first focus in Boston since it's a city that is not too saturdated
        by similar value propositions. Boston will allow us to gain credibility.
    </p>
    <h1>What content do you plan to include in each page?:</h1>
    <p>The homepage will include short and concise information about my website,
        what it does and how people using it can benefit it. Within the homepage directly
        fans will be able to view events. By clicking an event card they will be directed to the respective event page.
        Once the fan is ready to buy he will be directed to the checkout and payment process.
        The fan will be able to view pages like the organizer's profile, dj profile and an array
        of informative pages on what's new in the nightlife scene.
